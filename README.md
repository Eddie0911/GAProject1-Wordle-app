# **Project title: GAProject1-Wordle-app**

## Project Description ##
**Wordle-app** is a popular online word game where players are given a five-letter random word and must guess the word within a limited number of attempts. The objective of the game is to guess the word correctly by entering possible words into the game interface. Each attempt is marked with colored squares to indicate whether a letter is in the correct position or not. A green square indicates that the letter is in the correct position, and a yellow square indicates that the letter is in the word but in the wrong position. The game is won when the player correctly guesses the word within the given attempts, and it becomes progressively more challenging as the player advances to higher levels. Wordle is a simple yet addictive game that tests players' vocabulary skills and strategic thinking.
